<body style="background-color: #EDEDED;">
<P style="text-align: center;"><B>********** Note: Please send roster updates to <A HREF="mailto:masterroster@gmail.com">masterroster@gmail.com</A> - not to our personal addresses.  Thanks! **********</B>
<P>The master roster is a record of skater names, numbers, league names, team names, and team themes for all skaters, regardless of track type or WFTDA affiliation.  It is put together on a volunteer basis to ensure that all rollergirls feel rewarded for their creativity by maintaining exclusiveness for their names.  We hope that your league will appreciate the spirit of this roster, and make sure that none of your skaters appropriate the names of the hard-working skaters who are trying their best to make roller derby a success.

<P>Although the master roster is primarily filled with skater names, we also accept submissions for refs, statisticians, score keepers, etc.  Please be reasonable and only register staff members if they will be traveling on a national scale.

<P>The latest roster can be found in two places.
<UL>
  <LI>In the Files section of the "roller_girls" Yahoo group (under Master Roster).
  <LI>Online at: <A HREF="http://www.twoevils.org/rollergirls/">http://www.twoevils.org/rollergirls/</A></UL>
<P>The rules for getting your league's skaters on the master roster are as such:

<OL>
  <LI>Make sure that your skater(s) are really committed to your league before putting their names on the roster.
  <UL>
    <LI>Generally, this means requiring them to have attended practice regularly for at least a couple months.  </UL>
  <LI>Have one person in your league send in master roster updates.
  <UL>
    <LI>It's much easier to get updates from one person per league instead of each individual skater.
    <LI>It helps ensure that a given skater really does belong on the roster for your league.  </UL>
  <LI>Check all of your skater names against the <B>CURRENT</B> version of the master roster before submitting them.
  <UL>

    <LI>Duplicate names are not allowed under any circumstances.
    <UL>
      <LI>If a duplicate name is submitted, I will reply letting you know that a name was rejected.
    </UL>
    <LI>Similar names are strongly discouraged, and not allowed without permission from the original skater(s).
    <UL>
      <LI><B>WRITTEN</B> permission is required, as it is common for skaters to claim they have permission when they do not.
    </UL>
    <LI>The following will require permission from skaters with similar names:
    <UL>
      <LI>Names that are pronounced similarly (ie, "Paige Burner" and "Paige Burna")
      <LI>Names that are spelled similarly (ie, "Paige Burner", and "Page Burner")
		</UL>
    <LI>The following will be rejected:
			<UL>
      <LI>Names that are too generic (ie, "Rollergirl", "Skater", etc.)
      <LI>Names that begin with possessives (ie, "Your Worst Nightmare", "Her Bad Day", etc.)
      <LI>Names that end in verbs (ie, "Speed Skater" is okay, but not "Speed Skating")
      <LI>"First" names where First Name / Last Name combos already exist.  (ie, no plain "Anne", "Betty", "Cherry", etc.)
   		 </UL>
    <LI>Even if you meet all name requirements, rejection is still at the discretion of the roster maintainers.  Following the rules will provide you with the greatest chance of getting on the roster.  </UL>
  <LI>It is strongly discouraged for skaters to select names that duplicate existing team or league names, team names to duplicate existing skater names, and all variations of these situations.  <LI>New team names cannot be the same as another existing team name.  It's OK to have a common team theme, as everyone understands that there are only so many appropriate themes to go around.  But, try to avoid the more common team themes (hotrods/mechanics, cops, pirates, etc.)  And, if you do decide to use a team theme that's already in use, please try to put a new spin on it and make sure that your uniform is VERY different than the other teams using that theme, or you'll catch hell about it from that existing team!  <LI>Please send your <B>FULL</B> league name (not abbreviated) in the subject of your email.  <LI>If you are sending in your full league roster, please label the change that is being made for each skater (add, change, delete).  Also, check your roster regularly for skaters who are still on the master roster who are not skating anymore, so as to free up names for new girls.  <LI>Updates can be in any format (Excel, Word, or just plain text), but please send them in alphabetical order.  <LI>Updates are processed on a first-come-first-serve basis.  That means that a name that wasn't on the master roster when you submitted it to us might be rejected because somebody sent the name in a day earlier.  <LI>Please archive the emails that you send in.  This will help in the case of possible future name disputes.</OL>

<P>I guess that's about it.  Send us your stuff whenever you're ready, and we'll add it to the master roster.
<P>Thanks!
